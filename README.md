## Description

I decided to use some libraries to make the project nicer and to allow further addition of new features later.

- react-bootstrap - to make the layout similar to one on the screenshot
- redux - to create basis for the global state management that could be useful later
- redux-thunk - to fetch the data and save it in the store
- Highlight.js - to make code highlighting


Currently address field is not used and validated. Later on it could be validated and used as an real edpoint address instead of mocked filed.

I've added few tests of the responsesReducer.
